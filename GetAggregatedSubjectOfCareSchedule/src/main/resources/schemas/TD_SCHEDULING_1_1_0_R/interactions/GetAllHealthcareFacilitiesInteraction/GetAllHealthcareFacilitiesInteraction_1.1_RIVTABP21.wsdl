			 Tjänsteinteraktionens namn: GetAllHealthcareFacilitiesInteraction
			 Beskrivning: 
			   Interaction to retrieve the healthcare_facilities that are offered the subject of care for making appointments. The response depends on the provided argument. Subject of care id allows the producer to adjust the response according to the health history of the subject of care. If a bookingId is provided, the producer must restrict the response to the healthcare_facilities available for rescheduling the of the appointment identified by the bookingId. If the bookingId is provided, that is unknown to the producer, an empty list should be returned. This service contract has semantics different to all the other contracts within the scheduling domain. Like the other service contracts it is directed to a single healthcare_facilitiy, but it is responsible for providing a list of all viable healthcare_facilities according to the business rules of the regional healthcare administration. To summarize: For this particular service contract the responding healthcare_facility takes the role of the regional adminstration, in the context of the caretypes the healthcare_facility supports.
